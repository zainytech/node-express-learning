## Second Commit
In second commit I learned
- what is fs(filesystem) built-in module
  - we can use fs to read existing files and write to a new file.
  - There are 2 approaches to do read and write, synchronous and asynchronous.
    - in synchronous approach there is no callback function, its blocking approach.
    - in asynchronous approach there is a callback function that provides us error message or result and its a non-blocking approach.
